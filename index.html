            Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is
            how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and
            mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around,
            we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its
            usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the
            end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

            <span class="two-columns__span-accent">Here's the real question: </span>does this approach of repetition and
            memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic
            consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than
            any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point
            is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?
          </p>

            Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the
            educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep
            scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.

          Barbara Oakley&#8217;s story.
        </h2>

          <p class="two-columns__paragraph">
            Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of
            herself as more of a humanities person, and not a brilliant one at
            that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after school she enlisted
            in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of
            service, during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left
            the army and decided to study engineering. In was during this time
            that she developed her learning methodology as she was forced to
            reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out
            that when something doesn't come naturally to you, having to work
            hard to gain the knowledge that other people may get at first glance
            gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject
            matter.
